LavaLab AthenaADMET Project 

## To set up Conda venv, use this:
- conda env create -f environment.yml
- This makes sure RDKit, Python, and other dependencies are within version constraints and reduces conflicts amongst collaboration

## To push, pull, commit, or any git command
- Do this on regular path without venv
